## ðŸ§  Problems Solved

### Problem 1: Calculator using Class
- A simple calculator that performs **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**.
- Takes two `double` inputs (`a`, `b`) and a string indicating the operation (e.g., `"add"`, `"subtract"`).
- Implemented using a **C++ class**, as required.

### Problem 2: Odd Number Series Generator
- Given an input `a`, generates a series of the first `a` **odd numbers**.

### Problem 3: Conditional Odd Series Generator
- For an input `a`, prints the first `a` odd numbers **if `a` is odd**, or up to `a-1` terms if `a` is even.

### Problem 4: Count Multiples in a List
- Given a list of integers, counts how many are divisible by numbers 1 to 9.
